                    <h4>25.01.2015 | jsGameEngine Map System & Charakter sprites.</h4>
                    
                    by working on my jsGameEngine i adapt the first of two Map Systems which is in 2D.
                    The Background and Floor Areal are seperated DOM Elements which works together
                    with the Charakter Position. The Movement of the Map is effected by parallex,
                    which allows us to get kinda 3D moving of fore- and background. 
                    <br><br>
                    The Simple Collision detection (moving arround the map only in the floor areal)
                    is done and works except the End of the Map Point. I need to build some extra
                    functionality to "get Exit from level and trigger new Level" for this.
                    <br><br>
                    Also there is now the first atempt to get animated Charakter Sprites,
                    nothing special for now, based on the Charakter Class but nothig exactly. 
                    <br><br>

                    <h4>18.01.2015 | Post Categories Prepare</h4>
                    Preparation for the the Post Sections has been made.
                    I'm building the post functions with the additional functionality
                    to synch with the Social Networks in a simple way. So the main
                    posts will be host on Gkiokan.NET, while I'll be able to 'post'
                    and 'synch' my posts with facebook, google, twitter and Co.
                    Why this? Well I don't like to split my posts everywhere on any
                    Social Netork, even I know it would be helpfull to get them known.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides I'm able to use my posts in any kind of Service. Best
                    example will be thought my API for RSS, JSON, App Data and sort.

                    <h4>12.01.2015 | Profile Percentage Progess Circle & Projects Overview</h4>
                    You can now see how much % you got on your Profile Informations. This is a little expanded version from the beta Version before.
                    The Count is done by pure CSS, so that's really cool thought most Solutions on the Network is using Canvas Object.
                    <br><br>
                    And There is  a new View out for my Projects. So the Prototyped one has been gone completly and now with minimalistic Effects on stage. You get a basic Project Picture, Version Info and License Requiremets ( free to use, or User API Key req.).
                    <br><br>

                    <h4>11.01.2015 | Database as Service reBas</h4>
                    With DBaS by Gkiokan.NET you can use a dynamic Database for any Project you want. It provides a simple API with the basic request methods as an example of GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE, VERIFY, TOKEN.
                    <br><br>
                    The Positive Aspect here, everything will be hashed and only avaible for the owner of the DB - it's you - who is going to verfy your own with the API Key and the DB Key, so there is a two way user check and also providing a third security Option as of Domain binding which means you can limit your request only for the one Domain. This makes my DBaS so special and Secure im comparision to others. More Details on it soon on the DBaS Project Page.
                    <br><br>
                    It's return will be chooseable in several Forms, like JSON, XML, HTML, crypted, basic Text String and so on.
                    <br><br>
                    The Example Working Page with DBaS is in progress, hold in mind, it's comming!

                    q Generator is a little Project I'm building to recreate a users salt hash. On the Open Beta it have only a basic mark up and a very easy to use function without any OOP implementations yet.
                    <br>
                    I'll be updating it soon after my Dynamic Header JS Core has been finished. The new target will be to support more then md5 and base64 hash crypts and a mobile user friendly UI.
                    <br>
                    As this is only a pure basic it doesn't come with a clear install solution for now, but it provides a basic Idea what I am after.
                    Updates soon!

                    Just a little cool feature has been added to the Design.
                    This makes the look of the page a bit neather. Parallex
                    kinda simulates a tree Dimensional Perspective, looks cool.
                    Just play arround with your Mouse and get it.
                    As I can't get all my prefered Design Themes on it,
                    I'll allow you setup your own Theme... but this is just
                    an incomming Update.. stay updated!

                    <h4>30.12.2014 | DBaS Core ReBuild</h4>
                    As announced I've started a completly new Core Build for DBaS.
                    I just finished a really cool, clear and transparent function
                    to manage the input data, but well it's not finished yet but
                    has great potential to expand.<br>
                    On the functional Side, I could finish a simple request
                    and insert method. For now, it's simply execute function
                    and works very nice. Screenshots, Logs and Examples very soon!

                    <h4>29.12.2014 | Model View dynamic Expandation</h4>
                    One step closer to my dynamicly flexibly core MVC step was
                    the build of the function on including dynamicly different
                    headers and footers. So each view will be loaded by default
                    as the standart template till it gets changed by the view Obj
                    itself. So this means, I can say I wanna have Design X on
                    Start Screen but keep on Settings Pages Design Y.
                    This is also really usefulll for the Multiple Project Support
                    to keep them in different styles in that easy way.
                    Actually I'm thinking of a own CDN to serve, but lets see.
                    <br>
                    I also ReConstructed the DBaS Project and will start soon
                    with a clean core API, this time on v0.2.1. (as v0.1. was the old one).

                    Back to the main Project for now, I got some cool feature here.
                    OOP JS Design manipulating for the weeks cachel. Head over to
                    your entries in /myBook and just try it out. The Design is refined
                    in the collapse and in its fullset function and also in the dynamic
                    action events, which are buttons just behind the General lookup.
                    So what now? You can click to enlarge your week first, and then
                    you got the Option to enlage it to fullwidth, which hovers the week
                    with a background color.

                    <h4>23.12.2014 | JS Game Engine </h4>
                    I've been working on my new remake of <a href='svr.gkiokan.net/js_game_engine' target='_blank' class='label label-success'>JS Game Engine v.0.0.3</a>
                    It is completly in OOP JS, and the flexiblity is even more as before, that's really great.
                    So far I got the really basic in it, Player Model, and just made the FireModel
                    which allows you also to fire in the running direction, smooth running BoxModel...
                    Well this Project is there to kalm down from the MVC, somtimes I just need a Project swap
                    to clear minds. As you meight remember, this Game Engine isn't about running in canvas,
                    it will be build in javascript for DOM Model manipulating. More about it later...
                    <br>
                    I've always wanted to build my own Gaming Engine, but for the Time now there are so many great Frameworks out, so I skipped that Idea almost. Thought these all Frameworks running with canvas and are somehow fixed in the dynamical expanding of e.g. the level creation.
                    So I've started to build my own Engine finally, which works quite nice so far, without Canvas, and is pointing to an dynamical Level enchainment later on.  Whats the Idea behind it? Well, I want to use websites as the level itself, so anyone can Play his favourite WebSite as a level and destroy it or take a Story Line of it.
                    As I build it completly from scratch, with some extensions of jQuery for the sake of simplcy and quick build for now, I'll do more updates soon. Actually it is possible to open it, spawn new Players, move the main Charakter, and a simply FPS timer for the update & draw stuff.

                    It took me a little Time to add the Category functionality to the
                    BHS System, finally it works in association with it. As it is a
                    spezific Category to the BHS, I thought to add it in the same
                    Model as the BHS itself. For Generaly use I'll prepare a basic
                    versioini of it and extract it as a seperate Model to use it
                    without any fixed config.

                    <h4>12.12.2014 | BHS Update & Java GUI dev</h4>
                    Yeay, schooltime rocks. We've learned the basics of JAVA GUI
                    developing and started into InputStream methods, kinda cool stuff.
                    One of the best Part is, that I can use that all with my API
                    and grand user access thought my Lizens Token System.

                    However here comes a little MVC feature, called sub menu.
                    Each Project, Class and / or Object has it's own Sub Menu now.
                    Why? Let's assume you are in the BHS System and keep changing
                    from Site A to B, you have to click such many stuffs to get back.
                    So now the Solution is easy. Each Projects can show their own
                    Sub Menu Information, so there is no issue and long way to get back.
                    The awsome part is, there is no association with the Main Menu!

                    use it with the new one now. Therefore was a little core file update,
                    which preserves the basic functionality to Focus the User Model sep.
                    I'll leave the content CSS with the white Background for now and
                    prepare the Design Tool Editor for you, so you can shoose which
                    Theme you ever wanna have and stay with. It will be saved thought

                    I've done that update already on thuesday but anyways
                    writing now the news. The Berichtsheft System has been
                    almost done. I could finish the basics and put a little
                    Design on it. Also packed with that I've done the
                    Register & Login functionality, which will be expanded
                    soon after this little Project is running.
                    There are two little major updates to do before I can
                    go online for the testing Beta version. After a long time
                    there was a needen update for the ToDo list, too, so
                    I refined that. Additional to this, I'm not sure about
                    the Design which Sheme I should shoose, so I'll build
                    you an JS Option, that modifyies your prefered Sheme.

                    Hey folks, after a long day and a hard fight thought
                    the complexity of nothing, I could finally finish the
                    DB Wrapper Class for my Projects. This stuff took
                    more time then I ever would assume but however, not it's
                    finished and it works awsome. As e.g. I can user
                    get('Table', array('username')) as kinda Shortcode
                    to get the results back and they will be also build in
                    in every Subsite. Now there are some decissions out
                    to clear which Type of DB I should use? InnoDB, MyISAM,
                    CSV, crypedFile, DBaS, local, external, ISS... lets see.

                    I'm not really done with it at all, it works great,
                    but somehow I think there is more  potential.
                    Now it's possible to apply specifiy meta tags for
                    each View Controller, which will be handled thought
                    the sub controller. But it takes almost three methodes
                    to get it run smooth and flexibly. Maybe i'll change
                    that afterwards, but there is no reason to do so.
                    Sadly this couldn't been solved as quick as I thought,
                    so my db Class will wait for the days after tomorrow.

                    all Important Information of this at once. The one left space
                    is for the User Counter and Data assets, but however, as far
                    the MVC isn't finished completly this wouldn't bee usefull.
                    And also with this DIF, my first API json obj comes out.

                    There was a little Update in the core of my MVC, too.
                    Not only for error debugging purpose, but also to force
                    to get routes for the right Error Number you may need.
                    Also I'm working on the json request for my dbas

                    perfectly, e.g. /aboutme or /profil/me or /dev/test/bla/a/b/c.
                    There was also some changes in the .htaccess file I made before.
                    I have to recalculate the Methods how I want to exept them,

                    me a little to get the point I' am now. Well, there are some Options
                    that aren't compatible with my Server from Strato, so I'd to edit
                    and try again for the htaccess till it works. Well but now you're able
                    to use any multilvl link as adress, it will be automaticaly recognized by
                    my CMS and, it will automaticaly calculate the Variable and Usage of it.
                    Also I started to build the Design for the Backend. At last it schould be
